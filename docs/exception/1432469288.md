# Exception 1432469288

## Reason

You tried to call `->save()` or `->delete()` on your model but your request is not of type `POST`, `PUT` or `DELETE`,
but `GET` or `HEAD`.

## Explanation

`GET` and `HEAD` are considered [safe requests](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2). You must not change
model data to have idempotent requests.

## Solutions

* Add the `method="POST"` attribute to your HTML form tag.
* Force persistence of your model with the `$force` parameter
